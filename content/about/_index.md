Hi! I'm Effy, you can also call me 李雪 [lǐ xuě]. I am a PostDoctoral Researcher at CWI Amsterdam, in the [TRL lab](https://trl-lab.github.io/), led by [dr. ir. Madelon Hulsebos](https://www.madelonhulsebos.com/). I am interested in the topic of towards automating contextual data science, with an emphasis on data management. 

I did my PhD at University of Amsterdam in [INDE lab](https://indelab.org/), supervised by [Prof. Paul Groth](pgroth.com) and [Dr. Jan-Christoph Kalo](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=2EE-YUsAAAAJ&hl=de). During my PhD, I did an internship at [MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com/) on Data wrangling with LLMs.
Previously I was an AI resident at Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK. Before that I did my Masters' in Univeristy of Edinburgh.

My PhD topic was on Knowlege Graph Construction from Conversational Data. Specifically, I look into how can we better utilizing (large) language models to extract information such as entities and relations, and furthermore, making (large) language models more data-efficient, robust and adaptable. My PhD research was funded and situated in a NWO project [*IN-SIGHT.it*](https://in-sight.it/). 

I am originally from China and have lived in the UK and the Netherlands. When I am not in front of my laptop, you can often find me bouldering (in completely beginner level), cycling or drinking coffee (like everyone else :D). If you are keen to collaborate or exchange ideas over a cofee, you can reach out to me at <span style="color:blue">effy DOT li AT cwi DOT nl</span>.
